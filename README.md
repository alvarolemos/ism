# pyISM - Incremental Sequence Models for Python

## What is pyISM?
The pyISM is a Python package implementing a family of Incremental Sequence Models (ISMs) implemented with `tensorflow` with an `scikit-multiflow` API.

## How to install?
pip install -U git+https://github.com/alvarolemos/ism

## What are Incremental Sequence Models (ISMs)?
Due to Big Data and the Internet of Things, machine learning algorithms targeted specifically to model evolving data streams have gained attention from both academia and industry. Although most of the proposed solutions in the literature have reported being successful in learning from non-stationary streaming settings, their complexity and the need for extra resources may be a constraint for their deployment in real applications.

Incremental Sequence Models are a family of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to tackle evolving data streams, aiming at less complexity without losing performance. It was proposed in the research ``An Incremental Learning approach using Sequence Models'', to be presented by √Ålvaro Conde Lemos Neto as his Master's degree final dissertation in the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPGEE) of the Federal Univeristy of Minas Gerais (UFMG), supervisde by Prof. Criatiano Leite de Castro, PhD, both from the Machine Intelligence And Data Science (MINDS) lab.
